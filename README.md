# Dark Matter Mapping Pipeline

## Project Overview
This project develops an advanced image processing pipeline for dark matter mapping using galaxy and star image pairs. The pipeline implements sophisticated preprocessing techniques to handle atmospheric effects, reduce noise, and preserve crucial features in astronomical images.

## Project Status
ðŸš§ **Under Active Development** ðŸš§

This project is currently in development with ongoing improvements to the preprocessing pipeline. Installation instructions will be added once the pipeline stabilizes.

## Features

### Data Processing Pipeline
- Handles pairs of galaxy and star images (40,000 training, 60,000 test images)
- Processes atmospheric and telescope effects using Point Spread Function (PSF) from star images
- Implements advanced noise reduction while preserving galaxy features
- Manages pixelization effects with feature preservation

### Key Components

#### Data Loading (`data_loader.py`)
- Custom dataset implementation for galaxy-star image pairs
- Efficient batch processing with data augmentation options
- Configurable image preprocessing and normalization
